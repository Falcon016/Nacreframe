# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First release of the ground-up rewrite (replaces the earlier turtlebot harness).

- Agent loop with streaming, parallel read-only tools, steering, abort, session trees.
- **Compaction that cannot corrupt a conversation**: always on, at most 80% of the real context window, the chat is
  held while it runs, transactional and chunked, falls back to shorter tails, pauses instead of overflowing; dangling
  tool calls are repaired; tool results are capped.
- Providers: Anthropic and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, Unsloth Studio, vLLM...).
  Context windows are detected from the server. No default model.
- Approval modes `ask` / `edits` / `auto` / `plan` with rules; sandbox levels `off` / `guard` / `container`.
- Live browser control via Playwright with host policy and user take-over.
- Collaborative swarms in a shared channel with split-pane view; persistent, compacted, resumable like any session.
- Ink TUI with the Nacre theme; print / JSON / RPC modes.
- Self-hosted web dashboard (`nacre serve`): token auth, strict CSP, SSE streaming, approvals, context meter, swarm,
  live browser view; Docker and systemd deployment files.
- Extensions, skills, prompt templates, MCP client, `AGENTS.md`.
- `nacre models`, `nacre doctor`, `npm run live-check`.
